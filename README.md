TwitterBot
==========

For this project, I decided to interact with the community of those with eating disorders. The two hashtags I searched to create my bot were #edProblems and #LoveYourBody My bot is a way to reach out to those in the community to offer them words of comfort and a means to find help. My bot posts three types of posts: retweets(of recent #LoveYourBody tweets), tweets to those who have recently used the #edProblems hashtag, and tweets directed to no particular user that are a recurring motivating message including the #LoveYourBody hashtag and three random characters after the post so that the tweet will continue to print. The retweets are meant to inspire those that have come across the bot's tweets and decided to visit it's twitter page since those with eating disorders may be less likely to come across the #LoveYourBody hashtag, the tweets directed towards users are meant to provide those struggling with a reminder that there are different ways of dealing with their body image issues and a means to seek help (through a link to a website provided in the tweet), and the other tweets are meant to promote the #LoveYourBody hashtag as well as break up the other tweets and provide some original contend that is not directed specifically towards one person. This twitter bot is supposed to play a sympathetic and kind character and offer those in the community a reminder that there are other ways to deal with self hatred and other ways to learn to love your body than through eating disorders.
